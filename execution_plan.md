Multi-Step Form Execution Plan:

Date: 09th Dec, 2022.
I had to look at both mobile and desktop designs. Having read that mobile first approach is preferred, I will go with that.
common elements - c
uncommon elements - uc
execution - exe
Obervations:  
1.  Each page has 2 components - 
> exe. bind in ```<main>``` element with flex. body with req. bground.  

    (c) a. Page tracker - 1, 2, 3, 4 with background
            (c) i.  indicator   
            (c) ii. background  
    (uc)b. Form.  
            i. Personal Info  
            ii.  
2. monthly / yearly rates update - function/object to make necessary changes throughout all pages.


1. Mobile First Approach
